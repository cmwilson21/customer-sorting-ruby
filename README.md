# What The Program Does
This program is designed to read text files containing customer data and display that data showing only specific categories in a selected order.

## How The Program Works
Text files have been added into the programs directory. Determine if you would like the files to be displayed by the customer's name or by the vehicle type.

Run ruby customer-sorter.rb <sorting_method>. For example, to run the program to sort by customer name, enter the following into the command line interface:
ruby customer-sorter.rb name

Vice versa, to run the program to sort by vehicles, enter the following into the command line interface:
ruby customer-sorter.rb vehicle

The data will display itself in the terminal.
