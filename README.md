## How The Program Works

Text files have been added into the programs directory. Determine if you would like the files to be displayed by the customer's name or by the vehicle type.
Uncomment (place cursor on the line and press "command" + "/" at the same time to quickly comment lines in or out) the appropriate puts command at the end of the file to display by name or vehile type. Comment out the opposite puts command.
Run ruby customer-sorter.rb in the CLI.

If new files are introduced, simply add them as a variable by following the structure of lines 1 and 2. Then, underneath the class, add the variable and follow the same structure using variableName.each to iterate through the file and split the data into a the appropriate format for the data.
