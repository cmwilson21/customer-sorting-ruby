## How The Program Works

Text files have been added into the programs directory. Determine if you would like the files to be displayed by the customer's name or by the vehicle type.

Run ruby customer-sorter.rb in the CLI.

If new files are introduced, simply add them as a variable by following the structure of lines 1 and 2. Then, underneath the class, add the variable and follow the same structure using variableName.each to iterate through the file and split the data into a the appropriate format for the data.
